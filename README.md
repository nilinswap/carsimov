A traffic simulator project 

"Cities are built from poet's dreams." - read somewhere

## Idea
    [.] Owned 
    [.] Interesting 
    [.] Scope for learning (Graph, Javascript FE, Simulation, Probablistic modelling, Modular Programming )
    [.] Intimidating (scope is extensible to real city.)
    [.] Utility (KSRTC should do something with this.JK. This will use Path Navigation Algorithms used in robotics. )
    

## Goal Visuals

   I am seeing a bird's eye view of my city. It has all kind of roads - single lane
double lane. It has three-way and four-way crossroads. There are buildings on either side of
the road. Only buildings consume and produce vehicles. There are parking area adjacent to few roads.

Every car has a life for its journey from source to destination (buildings). Car has
a characteristic length and speed. This are the boilerplate features

Advanced Features
1. Road blockage insertion
2. make-way-for-Ambulance adherence
3. Criminal chase curve
4. Vast length options for vehicles
5. Race. ("I wonder if you know how they live in Tokyo. If you see me..")
6. Mapless navigation.

It will use python or rust at BE and javascript FE.

 
   
   

## Tools used for record keeping.
   - Github
    
## Milestones and Checkpoints

1. Inception
    
    - Set up a communication between backend and frontend.
    - Create a map and feed it no screen.
    - one car "Lola" will try and drive around the city without collision.
    - Lola will try making it to a point in the city.
    
 
2. Design

    - Life to Buildings
    - Life to Cars. There can be many varities.
    - Relationship of cars with Buildings and other cars.
    - Life to Roads. Relationship with cars.
    - Probablistically generous decisions
    
3. The Drop

    - Unleash vehicles from building based on a crowd control rate. let them be aimless
    - Give them vision
    - Solve problems( stopping right here)
